- if we continue the champions' thing

  - search by champion name, show most played champions first, from 100 or so requests
  - show damage/time /match, damageTaken/time /match, winrate, ...
  - nice to have: match history of the matches played by that champion
- if I make a match history:
  
  - gold graph (need to get from match history timeline api)
  - damage graph (like damage graph in lol (y axis = playerList))
  -
